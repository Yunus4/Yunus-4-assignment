        <section>India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[23] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia.</section>

        <section>Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[24][25][26] Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[27] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[28] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest,[29][30] unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.[31] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[32] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism</section>

        <section>ndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed in a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1.211 billion in 2011.[53] During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[54] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[55] It has a space programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[</section>

        <h3>Etymology</h3>
        <article>Main article: Names of India</article><br>
        <section>According to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name "India" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived successively from: Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία); ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός); Old Persian Hindush, an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire; and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or "river," specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[64][65] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates as "The people of the Indus"</section>

        <article>A 19th-century manuscript of the Rigveda, composed orally, 1500–1200 BCE;[29] the manuscript uses a 14th-century script style.</article>
        <section>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[24][25][26] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[24] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.[74] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[75][74] the first urban culture in South Asia</section>

        <article>An illustration from an early-modern manuscript of the Sanskrit epic Ramayana, composed in story-telling fashion c. 400 BCE – c. 300 CE.[73]</article>
        <section>During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[78] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[79] were composed during this period,[80] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[78] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.</section>
        <br>
        <section>In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[89][90] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.</section>
